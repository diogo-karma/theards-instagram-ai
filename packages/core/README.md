```tsx
// ./app/api/chat/route.js
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from 'openai-edge'
import { OpenAIStream, StreamingTextResponse } from 'ai'

const config = new Configuration({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
})
const openai = new OpenAIApi(config)

export const runtime = 'edge'

export async function POST(req) {
  const { messages } = await req.json()
  const response = await openai.createChatCompletion({
    model: 'gpt-4',
    stream: true,
    messages
  })
  const stream = OpenAIStream(response)
  return new StreamingTextResponse(stream)
}
```

```tsx
// ./app/page.js
'use client'

import { useChat } from 'ai/react'

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat()

  return (
    <div>
      {messages.map(m => (
        <div key={m.id}>
          {m.role}: {m.content}
        </div>
      ))}

      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
